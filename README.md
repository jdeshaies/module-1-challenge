# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The goal of this project was to update the Horiseon site to follow accessibility standards, optimize it for search engines, and consolidate the code. For the structure of the site, this meant adding an accurate title, including alt attributes to all images, utilizing semantic HTMLL elements, and ensuring all links functioned properly. For the styling, this meant removing unnecessary code that was redundant and that could be included in one section to address all similar components rather than in individual sections for each component under "Benefits" and "Services." Comments were also added throughout the project to make the code easier to understand.
